95.0,AI-Powered Customer Support Automation: Transforming Ticket Creation and Management.,2025,Mohammad Travadi,"The increasing frequency of customer inquiries and complaints in the digital era has put a strain on traditional support systems, resulting in inefficiencies and delayed responses. This paper describes an artificial intelligence- driven ticket automation system that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accelerate ticket production, classification, and resolution. Using frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system automates operations, increases response accuracy, and interacts smoothly with current support structures. The methodology entails preparing client queries for ticket classification, prioritizing, and multilingual translation, with Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for typical support scenarios. The system also accepts unsupervised queries and uses parallel processing to manage numerous tickets simultaneously, increasing throughput.  Evaluation indicators, such as efficiency gains (targeted at 10%) and response accuracy, demonstrate the system's real- world usefulness. The key findings reveal that manual classification errors are eliminated, and complicated or multilingual requests receive faster responses. However, issues remain in addressing ambiguous inquiries and maintaining broad AI compatibility, indicating areas for future improvement. Ongoing work will strengthen categorization algorithms, broaden industry support, and incorporate advanced sentiment analysis to improve issue priority.

94.9,LLM-based Approaches for Automatic Ticket Assignment: A Real-world Italian Application,2023,"Nicola Arici, ..., and I. Serina","IT service providers need to take care of errors, malfunctions, customizations and other issues every day. This is usually done through tickets: brief reports that describe a technical issue or a specific request sent by the users of the service. Tickets are often read by one or more human employees and then assigned to technicians or programmers in order to solve the raised issue. However, the increasing volume of such requests is leading the way to the automatization of this task. Since these tickets are written in natural language, in this paper we aim to exploit the new powerful pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-4 and its knowledge in order to understand the problem described in the tickets and to assign them to the right employee. In particular, we focus our work on how to formulate the request to the LLM, which information is needed and the performance of different zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and ensemble learning approaches.

94.6,Ticket-BERT: Labeling Incident Management Tickets with Language Models,2023,Zhexiong Liu,"An essential aspect of prioritizing incident tickets for resolution is efficiently labeling tickets with fine-grained categories. However, ticket data is often complex and poses several unique challenges for modern machine learning methods: (1) tickets are created and updated either by machines with pre-defined algorithms or by engineers with domain expertise that share different protocols, (2) tickets receive frequent revisions that update ticket status by modifying all or parts of ticket descriptions, and (3) ticket labeling is time-sensitive and requires knowledge updates and new labels per the rapid software and hardware improvement lifecycle. To handle these issues, we introduce Ticket- BERT which trains a simple yet robust language model for labeling tickets using our proposed ticket datasets. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of Ticket-BERT over baselines and state-of-the-art text classifiers on Azure Cognitive Services. We further encapsulate Ticket-BERT with an active learning cycle and deploy it on the Microsoft IcM system, which enables the model to quickly finetune on newly-collected tickets with a few annotations.",ArXiv,3,1.9,10.48550/arXiv.2307.00108,https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.00108,"{'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2307-00108', 'ArXiv': '2307.00108', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2307.00108', 'CorpusId': 254874498}",True,"{'url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00108', 'status': 'CLOSED'}",175996174c45d1c196d6dc2ad8e4f17bad4281e7,"- Proposes a BERT-based model for ticket categorization in incident management.

These tickets are assigned by support operators to the appropriate categories based on their personal experiences and the manually prepared keyword-matching catalogs. The dependency on individual experiences and the difficulty of maintaining and updating manually prepared catalogs increase the misclassification rate. This study aims to address a challenging multi-class classification problem in the Turkish language, which includes 172 classes, by utilizing large language models (LLMs). For this purpose, next-generation LLMs such as Titan, Llama, and Mistral are compared with BERT-based models using zero-shot, fine-tuning, and RAG methods within this st udy.

An issue report encapsulates a wealth of software-related information, encompassing problem descriptions, requests for new features and inquiries about the software product to name a few. As the volume of these issues escalates, manual management becomes increasingly challenging, prompting the exploration of automated approaches for more effective handling. This paper introduces ClassifAI 1, an automated Issue Report Categorization approach built on the foundation of the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa-Large model. ClassifAI proficiently classifies issue reports into three primary categories: Bug report, Enhancement/feature request, and Question.

14.6,Leveraging GPT-like LLMs to Automate Issue Labeling,2024,"Giuseppe Colavito, ..., and L. Quaranta","Issue labeling is a crucial task for the effective management of software projects. To date, several approaches have been put forth for the automatic assignment of labels to issue reports. In particular, supervised approaches based on the fine-tuning of BERT-like language models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance. More recently, decoder-only models such as GPT have become prominent in SE research due to their surprising capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance even for tasks they have not been trained for. To the best of our knowledge, GPT-like models have not been applied yet to the problem of issue classification, despite the promising results achieved for many other software engineering tasks. In this paper, we investigate to what extent we can leverage GPT-like LLMs to automate the issue labeling task. Our results demonstrate the ability of GPT-like models to correctly classify issue reports in the absence of labeled data that would be required to fine-tune BERT-like LLMs.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Documentation; Software evolution; Maintaining software; • Information systems → Clustering and classification;",2024 IEEE/ACM 21st International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR),8,10.2,10.1145/3643991.3644903,https://doi.org/10.1145/3643991.3644903,"{'DBLP': 'conf/msr/ColavitoLNQ24', 'DOI': '10.1145/3643991.3644903', 'CorpusId': 268246242}",False,,af9d32cbfaf107a018121be41786068c4be4c1ea,
13.9,Preprocessing Text Data for the Doc2Vec Model in the Automatic Classification of Tickets in Support Centers of Software Providers,2024,O. M. Shatalova and A. A. Kuzmin,"Leading software providers typically implement customer technical support functions, which are crucial for promoting and enhancing the competitiveness of their products and services in global markets. The high volume and heterogeneity of support tickets (functional, temporal, linguistic, etc.) highlight the importance of efficient classification systems. Effective classification optimizes the distribution of these tickets among support center specialists and automates their processing using an established knowledge base. However, classifying these tickets is a loosely formalized task. For companies that have accumulated substantial data on customer requests, automating classification through machine learning methods and natural language processing models, such as Word2Vec, FastText, BERT, and GPT, becomes feasible. It is generally accepted that classification effectiveness primarily depends on the model employed. Nevertheless, the quality of these models is significantly influenced by the nature of the training data. Literature review of the reveals significant research interest in methods for the automatic classification of tickets specifically tailored to the operational conditions of software provider support centers. However, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding the impact of data preprocessing on the quality of these models. The article aims to clarify the techniques of data preprocessing and analyze their impact on the effectiveness of text classification, considering the specificity of software provider support centers. This study examines the stages of the automatic classification process for tickets, accounting for the unique characteristics of the data (customer text requests). A relevant set of specified methodological and instrumental tools was developed and tested using open data from a global software provider (DevExpress). The testing involved a database of 165,000 tickets. The study's results indicate that preprocessing can improve classification metrics such as F-measure, Precision, and Recall from 77% to 79%.

10.5,An Intelligent Framework for Issue Ticketing System Based on Machine Learning,2018,"Ruanda Qamili, ..., and Johannes Schneider","Due to the rapid shift of companies towards superb customer experience and satisfaction, ticketing systems have come into a prominence and represent a strategic element in business competitiveness. Different software companies have developed very effective software tools for issue tracking, nevertheless, some sub-processes and tasks within the ticketing systems are still performed manually. These manually performed tasks represent bottlenecks, especially at large organizations they result in declined productivity and increased response time. Advancements in machine learning can be used in a novel way in which they are combined with the traditional issue tracking and ticketing systems on the market, to enable optimal operational efficiency in the Customer Service and Support(CSS) Department of large-scale businesses that deal with customer reports.

10.2,THE AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION APPROACH ON TELCO TROUBLE TICKET DATASET,2021,"Fauzy Che, ..., and Choo-Yee Ting","This paper presents automated machine learning for solving a practical problem of a telco trouble ticket system. In particular, the paper's focus is on the classification of early resolution code from the trouble ticket dataset. The number of trouble tickets is rising every year due to the new challenges from the digital world. It is a challenging job to evaluate the vast content of the trouble tickets manually. Past trouble ticket contains essential information about the root cause and the resolution to each problem. The main contribution of providing the early resolution code for each new trouble ticket can significantly reduce Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) for the telco operation, thus improves customer satisfaction and minimize telco business and operation costs. The research methods include the existing traditional model and its modification towards the best accuracy. Automated Predictive Engine (AutoPE) improves the current traditional engineered model's classification accuracy from 5% to 38% when using the optimal performing solution by implementing AutoML and Grid Search. This solution uses multiple classifiers such as Random Forest, Deep Learning, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Extremely Randomized Trees classifiers on a set of features based on various telco serviceable broadband zones and sampling size. Finally, compared to the baseline existing traditional engineered model, the best performing solution also improves the quality of classification for the early resolution code for the telco trouble tickets dataset.",Journal Not Provided,4,1.0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7d185da8e12bcd2e50924001cc4555a16579018,{'CorpusId': 248096571},False,,d7d185da8e12bcd2e50924001cc4555a16579018,
9.5,Language Models as Knowledge Bases?,2019,"F. Petroni, ..., and Sebastian Riedel","Recent progress in pretraining language models on large textual corpora led to a surge of improvements for downstream NLP tasks. Whilst learning linguistic knowledge, these models may also be storing relational knowledge present in the training data, and may be able to answer queries structured as “fill-in-the-blank” cloze statements. Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-the-art pretrained language models. We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably well on open-domain question answering against a supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are learned much more readily than others by standard language model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as unsupervised open-domain QA systems.

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,10304,1888.4,10.18653/v1/D19-1410,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/D19-1410,"{'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-1908-10084', 'ACL': 'D19-1410', 'ArXiv': '1908.10084', 'MAG': '2971193649', 'DOI': '10.18653/v1/D19-1410', 'CorpusId': 201646309}",True,"{'url': 'https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1410.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID'}",93d63ec754f29fa22572615320afe0521f7ec66d,

To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′ that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x̂, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies.

The ability to rapidly and efficiently react and solve reported issues is in fact a key factor from the customers' perspective, resulting in positive feedback for the company, leading to higher economic and brand-image revenues. The automatic detection of failures from maintenance tickets and support requests can grant faster and more efficient reactions to customers' equipment failures as well as reduced maintenance costs. The analysis of support and maintenance requests is a well-known problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). State-of-the-art solutions in this field rely on Transformers models, pre-trained on large text corpora, and then fine-tuned on the specific downstream task. However, due to their intrinsic nature, support requests are highly domain-specific and usually similar to short telegraph messages, where the focus is typically encapsulated in short sequences rather than in long dependencies. Hence, ad-hoc methods for pattern recognition might provide comparable performances with respect to Transformers. In this work, two alternative approaches are proposed, based on: Kernel Meth-ods in conjunction with Boost Decision Trees (SpectrumBoost), and Neural Networks for Multiple Representation Learning (DeepMRL).

This approach is designed to enhance the model’s ability to understand context, manage conversational states, and generate responses that are not only accurate but also contextually appropriate.The implementation of this novel method was rigorously evaluated on the dataset, with a focus on metrics such as response accuracy, contextual relevance, and customer satisfaction indicators. The results demonstrated significant improvements over baseline models, showcasing enhanced response generation capabilities. Key findings include a marked increase in the model’s ability to resolve queries in fewer interaction rounds and its enhanced capability to adapt responses based on the customer’s sentiment and query complexity.By bridging the gap between theoretical LLM architectures and practical, scalable applications for customer support, this research contributes to the ongoing evolution of conversational AI.

In practice, the number of labels are very large and organized in form of a tree. It is non-trivial to describe the issue completely and attach appropriate labels unless one knows the cause of the problem and the related labels. Sometimes domain experts discuss the issue with the users and change the ticket labels accordingly, without modifying the ticket description. This results in inconsistent and badly labeled data, making it hard for supervised algorithms to learn from. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating a conversational helpdesk system, which will ask relevant questions to the user, for identification of the right category and will then raise a ticket on users' behalf. We use attention based seq2seq model to assign the hierarchical categories to tickets. We use a slot filling model to help us decide what questions to ask to the user, if the top-k model predictions are not consistent.

The primary objective of the system is to determine the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket and then automatically dispatch it to an appropriate resolver group with high accuracy. While meeting this objective, it should also meet the objective of being able to operate at desired accuracy levels in the face of changing business needs by automatically adapting to the changes. The proposed system uses a system of classifiers with separate strategies for handling frequent and sparse resolver groups augmented with a semiautomatic rule engine and retraining strategies to ensure that it is accurate, robust, and adaptive to changing business needs.

5.6,Automatically Resolve Trouble Tickets with Hybrid NLP,2020,"Nicolas Ferland, ..., and Jieneng Yang","Application service providers manage huge and complicated infrastructures. Like any complicated systems, things could go wrong due to various reasons (e.g. network connection response problems, infrastructure resource limitations, software malfunctioning issues, etc.) from time to time. How to quickly resolve issues when they happen becomes critical to help improve customer satisfaction and retention. Recently, fast advancement of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have helped solving many practical problems by analyzing text information. Powerful algorithms have been developed to interpret human language and derive predictions. Ensemble models are also well suited to further improve performances as they can further explore the latent space to take advantage of features/weights discovered from a group of trained models. In this paper, we will introduce efficient machine learning algorithms to help application service providers manage and automatically resolve trouble tickets to significantly improve user experience and operational efficiency. We propose a hybrid approach to use both unsupervised clustering approach and supervised deep learning embedding to maximize the feature exploration and learning efficacy. Then we ensemble multiple optimized models to build the recommendation engine.

5.5,STAR: A System for Ticket Analysis and Resolution,2017,"Wubai Zhou, ..., and G. Grabarnik","In large scale and complex IT service environments, a problematic incident is logged as a ticket and contains the ticket summary (system status and problem description). The system administrators log the step-wise resolution description when such tickets are resolved. The repeating service events are most likely resolved by inferring similar historical tickets. With the availability of reasonably large ticket datasets, we can have an automated system to recommend the best matching resolution for a given ticket summary. In this paper, we first identify the challenges in real-world ticket analysis and develop an integrated framework to efficiently handle those challenges. The framework first quantifies the quality of ticket resolutions using a regression model built on carefully designed features. The tickets, along with their quality scores obtained from the resolution quality quantification, are then used to train a deep neural network ranking model that outputs the matching scores of ticket summary and resolution pairs. This ranking model allows us to leverage the resolution quality in historical tickets when recommending resolutions for an incoming incident ticket. In addition, the feature vectors derived from the deep neural ranking model can be effectively used in other ticket analysis tasks, such as ticket classification and clustering. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated with a large real-world dataset.",Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,38,5.1,10.1145/3097983.3098190,https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098190,"{'MAG': '2743886523', 'DBLP': 'conf/kdd/ZhouXBWZLXLSG17', 'DOI': '10.1145/3097983.3098190', 'CorpusId': 33259804}",False,,9b4bcecf5134d70b8ff6036b9cfe57a3ff74bbd8,

O'Malley","The U.S. Navy is successfully using natural language processing (NLP) and common machine-learning (ML) algorithms to categorize and automatically route plain text support requests at a Navy fleet support center. The algorithms enhance routine IT support tasks with automation and reduce the workload of service desk agents. The ML pipeline works in a five-step process. First, an archive of documents is created from various sources, including standard operating procedure (SOP) memos, frequently asked questions (FAQs), knowledge articles, Wikipedia articles, encyclopedia articles, previously closed support requests, and other relevant documents. Next, a library of words and phrases is generated from the archive. Then, this library is used to vectorize an incoming support request, producing a term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vector. Following, the TF-IDF vector is used to compute similarity scores between the support request and the documents in the previously-created archive. Finally, the similarity scores are processed by support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to categorize and route the incoming support request to the correct support provider. This algorithm was deployed at a U.S. Navy customer support center as part of a pilot study, where it decreased the amount of time agents spend on tickets by 35%; the amount of time required to assign tickets by 74%; and the amount of time to close tickets by 60%.

An issue is captured as summary on the ticket and once a ticket is resolved, the solution is also noted down on the ticket as resolution. It will be beneficial to automatically extract information from the description of tickets to improve operations like identifying critical and frequent issues, grouping of tickets based on textual content, suggesting remedial measures for them etc. In particular, the maintenance people can save a lot of effort and time if they have access to past remedial actions for similar kind of tickets raised earlier based on history data. In this work we propose an automated method based on deep neural networks for recommending resolutions for incoming tickets. We use ideas from deep structured semantic models (DSSM) for web search for such resolution recovery. We project a small subset of existing tickets in pairs and an incoming ticket to a low dimensional feature space, following which we compute the similarity of an existing ticket with the new ticket.

An essential task of ticket automation is to assign experts to solve upcoming tickets. However, facing thousands of tickets, inappropriate assignments will make tickets transfer frequently among experts, which causes time delays and wasted resources. Effectively and efficiently finding an appropriate expert in fewer steps is vital to ticket automation. In this paper, we proposed a sequence to sequence based translation model combined with a recurrent recommendation network to recommend appropriate experts for tickets. The sequence to sequence model transforms the ticket description into the corresponding resolution for capturing the potential and useful features of representing tickets. The recurrent recommendation network recommends the appropriate expert based on the assumption that the previous expert in the recommendation sequence cannot solve the expert. To evaluate the performance, we conducted experiments to compare several baselines with SSR-TA on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the baselines.

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText.

With the advancement of artificial intelligent, machine learning and deep learning, machines have started to impersonate as human. Conversational software agents activated by natural language processing is known as chatbot, are an excellent example of such machine. This paper presents a survey on existing chatbots and techniques applied into it. It discusses the similarities, differences and limitations of the existing chatbots. We compared 11 most popular chatbot application systems along with functionalities and technical specifications. Research showed that nearly 75% of customers have experienced poor customer service and generation of meaningful, long and informative responses remains a challenging task. In the past, methods for developing chatbots have relied on hand-written rules and templates. With the rise of deep learning these models were quickly replaced by end-to-end neural networks. More specifically, Deep Neural Networks is a powerful generative-based model to solve the conversational response generation problems. This paper conducted an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over 70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 5 years.

We address this gap by collecting a multilingual social media corpus containing customer service conversations (865k tweets), comparing various pipelines of pretraining and finetuning approaches, applying them on 5 different end tasks.

In particular, we compare the performance of TF-IDF and linguistic features-based text representations designed for ticket complexity prediction. We apply various classifiers, including kNN, its enhanced versions, decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, as well as semi-supervised techniques to predict the ticket class label of low, medium, or high complexity. Finally, we discuss the evaluation results and their practical implications.

The difficulty of this task lies in translating the human language into a mathematical format: transforming a non-formal language, into a formal one, without losing any details.

This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

Two machine learning and natural language processing techniques are demonstrated: one relying on feature engineering (COTA v1) and the other exploiting raw signals through deep learning architectures (COTA v2). COTA v1 employs a new approach that converts the multi-classification task into a ranking problem, demonstrating significantly better performance in the case of thousands of classes. For COTA v2, we propose an Encoder-Combiner-Decoder, a novel deep learning architecture that allows for heterogeneous input and output feature types and injection of prior knowledge through network architecture choices. This paper compares these models and their variants on the task of ticket classification and answer selection, showing model COTA v2 outperforms COTA v1, and analyzes their inner workings and shortcomings.

Laradji","The ability to detect intent in dialogue systems has become increasingly important in modern technology. These systems often generate a large amount of unlabeled data, and manually labeling this data requires substantial human effort. Semi-supervised methods attempt to remedy this cost by using a model trained on a few labeled examples and then by assigning pseudo-labels to further a subset of unlabeled examples that has a model prediction confidence higher than a certain threshold. However, one particularly perilous consequence of these methods is the risk of picking an imbalanced set of examples across classes, which could lead to poor labels. In the present work, we describe Top-K K-Nearest Neighbor (TK-KNN), which uses a more robust pseudo-labeling approach based on distance in the embedding space while maintaining a balanced set of pseudo-labeled examples across classes through a ranking-based approach.

Carid'a","In the last few years, three major topics received increased interest: deep learning, NLP and conversational agents. Bringing these three topics together to create an amazing digital customer experience and indeed deploy in production and solve real-world problems is something innovative and disruptive. We introduce a new Portuguese financial domain language representation model called BERTau. BERTau is an uncased BERT-base trained from scratch with data from the Itau virtual assistant chatbot solution. The novelty of this contribution lies in that BERTau pretrained language model requires less data, reaches state-of-the-art performance in three NLP tasks, and generates a smaller and lighter model that makes the deployment feasible. We developed three tasks to validate our model: information retrieval with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) from Itau bank, sentiment analysis from our virtual assistant data, and a NER solution. All proposed tasks are real-world solutions in production on our environment and the usage of a specialist model proved to be effective when compared to Google BERT multilingual and the Facebook’s DPRQuestionEncoder, available at Hugging Face. BERTau improves the performance in 22% of FAQ Retrieval MRR metric, 2.1% in Sentiment Analysis F1 score, 4.4% in NER F1 score.

2.4,Transformers in Vision: A Survey,2021,"Salman Hameed Khan, ..., and M. Shah","Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks, e.g., Long short-term memory. Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text, and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers, i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization), and three-dimensional analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges toward the application of transformer models in computer vision.",ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2118,521.3,10.1145/3505244,https://doi.org/10.1145/3505244,"{'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2101-01169', 'ArXiv': '2101.01169', 'DOI': '10.1145/3505244', 'CorpusId': 230435805}",True,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01169', 'status': 'GREEN'}",3a906b77fa218adc171fecb28bb81c24c14dcc7b,

However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining.

2.2,"Hi, how can I help you?: Automating enterprise IT support help desks",2017,"Senthil Mani, ..., and Hema Venkatarangan","    Question answering is one of the primary challenges of natural language understanding. In realizing such a system, providing complex long answers to questions is a challenging task as opposed to factoid answering as the former needs context disambiguation. The different methods explored in the literature can be broadly classified into three categories namely: 1) classification based, 2) knowledge graph based and 3) retrieval based. Individually, none of them address the need of an enterprise wide assistance system for an IT support and maintenance domain. In this domain, the variance of answers is large ranging from factoid to structured operating procedures; the knowledge is present across heterogeneous data sources like application specific documentation, ticket management systems and any single technique for a general purpose assistance is unable to scale for such a landscape. To address this, we have built a cognitive platform with capabilities adopted for this domain. Further, we have built a general purpose question answering system leveraging the platform that can be instantiated for multiple products, technologies in the support domain. The system uses a novel hybrid answering model that orchestrates across a deep learning classifier, a knowledge graph based context disambiguation module and a sophisticated bag-of-words search system. This orchestration performs context switching for a provided question and also does a smooth hand-off of the question to a human expert if none of the automated techniques can provide a confident answer.

1.6,Machine Learning Based Ticket Classification in Issue Tracking Systems,2014,Mucahit Altintas and A. C. Tantug,"Due to the rise of usage of virtual systems, support ticket systems have come into prominence. Addressing the issue tickets to appropriate person or unit in the support team has critical importance in order to provide improved end user satisfaction while ensuring better allotment of support recourses. The assignment of help ticket to appropriate group is still manually performed. Especially at large organizations, the manual assignment is not applicable sufficiently. It is time consuming and requires human efforts. There may be mistakes due to human errors. Also resource consumption is carried out ineffectively because of the misaddressing. On the other hand, manual assignment increases the response time which result in end user satisfaction deterioration. Multiple-choice systems which provide the user to choose the related categories or unit within defined categories may seem like better, but the systems are not useful because of those users, especially new users which have never used the system before, usually have no idea about the related category or department. Also users do not want to fill long ticket forms which are needed to identify the issue. In this study, an extension to ITS for auto-addressing the issue ticket to the relevant person or unit in support team is proposed. In this system, bag of word approach, machine learning techniques and other algorithms which proven performance in text processing are used. The recommended method provides high quality user support and boosts end-user satisfaction. It reduces manual efforts and human errors while ensuring high service levels and improved end-user satisfaction.",Journal Not Provided,18,1.6,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d2a9e7ae7169e91f42fb2b3e8901c2d0bee8244,"{'MAG': '2903029869', 'CorpusId': 793987}",False,,2d2a9e7ae7169e91f42fb2b3e8901c2d0bee8244,

In this work, we demonstrate that certain attention heads of a visually grounded language model actively ground elements of language to image regions. Specifically, some heads can map entities to image regions, performing the task known as entity grounding. Some heads can even detect the syntactic relations between non-entity words and image regions, tracking, for example, associations between verbs and regions corresponding to their arguments. We denote this ability as syntactic grounding.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end automated helpdesk email ticket assignment system, which is also offered as a service. The objective of the system is to determine the nature of the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket and then automatically dispatch it to an appropriate resolver group (or team) for resolution.The proposed system uses an ensemble classifier augmented with a configurable rule engine. While design of a classifier that is accurate is one of the main challenges, we also need to address the need of designing a system that is robust and adaptive to changing business needs. We discuss some of the main design challenges associated with email ticket assignment automation and how we solve them. The design decisions for our system are driven by high accuracy, coverage, business continuity, scalability and optimal usage of computational resources.Our system has been deployed in production of three major service providers and currently assigning over 90,000 emails per month, on an average, with an accuracy close to 90% and covering at least 90% of email tickets. This translates to achieving human-level accuracy and results in a net saving of more than 50000 man-hours of effort per annum.

1.5,DeepLabel: Automated Issue Classification for Issue Tracking Systems,2022,"Zhong Li, ..., and Xuandong Li","With the growth of Issue Tracking Systems, issue reports have become an important data to aid software maintenance and evaluation. Issue classification is one of the most important methods for such purpose, which aims to automatically distinguish issues related to bugs from other issues via machine learning algorithm. However, existing issue classification approaches are still inadequate due to either the incorrect usages of the textual fields of the issues or the ineffective feature representation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel issue classification approach named DeepLabel for achieving advanced issue classification. DeepLabel predicts the issue types by the ensemble of field-specific models that are applied on different textual fields, so as to make the maximum use of the information contained in the textual fields. In addition, DeepLabel adopts Word2Vec combined with attention-based Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (ABLSTM) as the feature extractor for the field-specific models in order to effectively extract the semantic information from the textual fields. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of DeepLabel based on a widely used issue dataset. The results demonstrate that DeepLabel can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, in which DeepLabel correctly identifies more bug issues (160.1 vs. 140.1) and more non-bug issues (345.7 vs. 325.4) on average compared to the best one existing approach.",Proceedings of the 13th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Internetware,3,1.1,10.1145/3545258.3545276,https://doi.org/10.1145/3545258.3545276,"{'DBLP': 'conf/internetware/LiPPZWL22', 'DOI': '10.1145/3545258.3545276', 'CorpusId': 252306827}",False,,c50ef6410efbc337f607851c545fbff1bdf05b33,
1.4,Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents,2014,Quoc V. Le and Tomas Mikolov,"Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ""powerful,"" ""strong"" and ""Paris"" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations.

1.4,Hyperparameter Black-Box Optimization to Improve the Automatic Classification of Support Tickets,2023,"R. Bruni, ..., and Pasquale Papa","User requests to a customer service, also known as tickets, are essentially short texts in natural language. They should be grouped by topic to be answered efficiently. The effectiveness increases if this semantic categorization becomes automatic. We pursue this goal by using text mining to extract the features from the tickets, and classification to perform the categorization. This is however a difficult multi-class problem, and the classification algorithm needs a suitable hyperparameter configuration to produce a practically useful categorization. As recently highlighted by several researchers, the selection of these hyperparameters is often the crucial aspect. Therefore, we propose to view the hyperparameter choice as a higher-level optimization problem where the hyperparameters are the decision variables and the objective is the predictive performance of the classifier. However, an explicit analytical model of this problem cannot be defined. Therefore, we propose to solve it as a black-box model by means of derivative-free optimization techniques. We conduct experiments on a relevant application: the categorization of the requests received by the Contact Center of the Italian National Statistics Institute (Istat). Results show that the proposed approach is able to effectively categorize the requests, and that its performance is increased by the proposed hyperparameter optimization.",Algorithms,1,0.5,10.3390/a16010046,https://doi.org/10.3390/a16010046,"{'DBLP': 'journals/algorithms/BruniBP23', 'DOI': '10.3390/a16010046', 'CorpusId': 255638009}",True,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/1/46/pdf?version=1673781219', 'status': 'GOLD'}",5f9dc4c57225d2be8ebeefe5a1c0689ee7e0b486,

1.3,A multiapproach generalized framework for automated solution suggestion of support tickets,2021,"Syed S. Ali Zaidi, ..., and Sharifullah Khan","Nowadays, customer support systems are one of the key factors in maintaining any big company's reputation and success. These systems are capable of handling a large number of tickets systemically and provides a mechanism to track/logs the communication between customer and support agents. Companies invest huge amounts of money in training support agents and deploying customer care services for their products and services. Support agents are responsible for handling different customer queries and implementing required actions to solve a particular issue or problem raised by the service/product user. In a bigger picture, customer support systems could receive a large amount of ticket raised depending upon the number of users and services being offered. Customer care service gets directly affected due to the high volume of tickets and a limited number of support agents. Therefore, providing support agents with the recommendations about the possible resolution actions for a new ticket would be helpful and can save a lot of time. This study is focused on the development of an end‐to‐end framework for suggesting resolution actions rather than recommending free form resolution text against a newly raised ticket. To develop such a system, the pipeline is broadly divided into four components that are data preprocessing, actions extractor, resolution predictor, and evaluation. In actions extractor module, we have proposed a technique to identify and extract actionable phrases from resolution text. For resolution predictor, we have proposed two different pipelines that are referred as “Similarity Search Model” and “End‐to‐End Model.” The similarity search method is based on a ticket similarity search to find the most relevant historical tickets which then leads to corresponding resolution actions. On the other hand, end‐to‐end model make use of actions extractor module directly and implemented in a way to directly predict resolution actions. To compare and evaluate the mentioned methods on the same ground, we also proposed an actions evaluation criterion which uses BertScore and METEOR score jointly to compute the score against actual and predicted actions for a particular test ticket. The analysis and experiments are performed on the real‐world IBM ticket data set. Overall, we observed that end‐to‐end model outperformed similarity search‐based methods and achieved better performance and scores comparatively.

1.2,CatIss: An Intelligent Tool for Categorizing Issues Reports using Transformers,2022,M. Izadi,"Users use Issue Tracking Systems to keep track and manage issue reports in their repositories. An issue is a rich source of software information that contains different reports including a problem, a request for new features, or merely a question about the software product. As the number of these issues increases, it becomes harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic approaches are proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports. This paper describes CatIss, an automatic Categorizer of Issue reports which is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss classifies issue reports into three main categories of Bug report, Enhancement/feature request, and Question. First, the datasets provided for the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained RoBERTa model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on about 80 thousand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very well surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving 87.2% F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained on a wide set of repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence applicable for any unseen software project or projects with little historical data. Scripts for cleaning the datasets, training CatIss and evaluating the model are publicly available. 1",2022 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Natural Language-Based Software Engineering (NLBSE),18,6.4,10.1145/3528588.3528662,https://doi.org/10.1145/3528588.3528662,"{'ArXiv': '2203.17196', 'DBLP': 'conf/nlbse/Izadi22', 'DOI': '10.1145/3528588.3528662', 'CorpusId': 247839321}",True,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3528588.3528662', 'status': 'BRONZE'}",daac22b0a9ba2e01182c37ec2933c45eb3f9f30c,

To achieve the said objective industries often opt for Ticketing system to handle unforeseen service interrupting events. These unforeseen events are also termed as ’incident’. Incident management processes provide quick fixes or workarounds to solve the incident and ensure little or no business impact. Traditionally, the incidents have been manually assigned to the concern teams which has sometimes resulted in human errors, resource consumption, higher response and resolution times and ultimately poor customer service.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU.

0.8,Automated Assignment of Helpdesk Email Tickets: An Artificial Intelligence Life-Cycle Case Study,2020,Shivali Agarwal,"Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved. ISSN 0738-4602 Fall 2020 45 The landscape of modern information technology service delivery is changing, with increased focus on automation and optimization. Most information technology vendors today have service platforms aimed toward end-to-end automation for carrying out mundane, repetitive labor-intensive tasks and even for tasks requiring human cognizance. One such task is ticket assignment and dispatch, where the service requests submitted by the end-users to the vendor in the form of tickets are reviewed by a centralized dispatch team and assigned to the appropriate service team and resolver group. The dispatch of a ticket to the correct group of practitioners is a critical step in the speedy resolution of a ticket. Incorrect dispatch decisions can significantly increase the total turnaround time for ticket resolution, as observed in a study of an actual production system (agarwal, Sindhgatta, and Sengupta 2012). When such delays occur, it causes customer dissatisfaction as well as monetary penalties for the vendor due to service-level-agreement breaches. Several factors make the dispatcher’s job challenging, namely the need for in-depth knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of various groups, the heterogeneous and informal nature of email text, and the high attrition rate in service delivery teams (Mandal et al. 2018). Given the fact that inefficiencies in dispatch have serious business consequences, there has been a lot of interest in automating the assignment process. a number of different approaches have been proposed for automating ticket dispatch (agarwal, Sindhgatta, and Sengupta 2012; Shao et al. 2008a, 2008b; Parvin, Bose, and Van Oyen 2009).  In this article, we present an endto-end automated helpdesk email ticket assignment system driven by high accuracy, coverage, business continuity, scalability, and optimal usage of computational resources. The primary objective of the system is to determine the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket and then automatically dispatch it to an appropriate resolver group with high accuracy. While meeting this objective, it should also meet the objective of being able to operate at desired accuracy levels in the face of changing business needs by automatically adapting to the changes. The proposed system uses a system of classifiers with separate strategies for handling frequent and sparse resolver groups augmented with a semiautomatic rule engine and retraining strategies to ensure that it is accurate, robust, and adaptive to changing business needs. Our system has been deployed in the production of six major service providers in diverse service domains and currently assigns 100,000 emails per month, on an average, with an accuracy close to ninety percent and covering at least ninety percent of email tickets. This translates to achieving human-level accuracy and results in a net savings of more than 50,000 man-hours of effort per annum. To date, our deployed system has already served more than two million tickets in production.

0.8,DeepRouting: A Deep Neural Network Approach for Ticket Routing in Expert Network,2020,Jianglei Han and Aixin Sun,"Ticket routing is a part of software support process, where multiple expert groups are involved in processing incident tickets. The goal of routing is to find an expert group which can resolve a ticket at the initial assignment, or when it needs to be transferred to another group. Matching a ticket to its potential resolver effectively provides significant business value for both service providers and their customers. Previous works used hand-crafted features to train predictive models to automate or assist in routing. One of the findings shows that, the similarity between a ticket and an expert group is prominent in identifying the resolver among other groups. Meanwhile, numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of deep neural networks in text similarity modeling problems. In this paper, we propose a multi-view deep neural network solution to jointly learn a relevance score for a ticket-group pair, using both text and routing path information. The text relevance is modeled by a classic deep semantic matching model, while the routing graph representation is embedded using a convolutional graph network. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline models in resolver ranking and assistive routing tasks. Comparative experiments also show that text has higher importance than routing path information.",2020 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC),8,1.9,10.1109/SCC49832.2020.00057,https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC49832.2020.00057,"{'MAG': '3112382384', 'DBLP': 'conf/IEEEscc/HanS20', 'DOI': '10.1109/SCC49832.2020.00057', 'CorpusId': 228098600}",False,,0dfaf97088938c6f25f550a136a8c20227c68d5e,
0.7,Building Intelligent Service Desk Systems using AI,2019,Paramesh S.P. and Shreedhara K.S.,"Service desk system helps the users of the organization to raise the problem tickets by selecting the appropriate problem category and to obtain the solution to user problems. Manual selection of ticket category may result in dispatching the tickets to incorrect resolution group. Incorrect assignment of service desk tickets in turn results in reassignment of tickets, resolution time delay and greatly affects the organization business. The current service desk system does not handle the user’s unstructured ticket data efficiently. Therefore, artificial intelligence concepts like machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be used to automate the existing service desk systems. In this research paper, an automated service desk ticket classifier model is developed to automatically categorize the incoming ticket by analyzing the unstructured natural language ticket description entered by the end user. Supervised machine learning techniques like Decision trees and Naive Bayes models are used as baseline classifiers to build the service desk ticket classifier. Further, ensemble models are also used to analyze the performance of ticket classifier. Ensemble of decision trees, naive bayes and Random Forest classifiers are used as a part of ensemble classifier techniques. The performance of chosen ticket classifier models are evaluated on a real world IT infrastructure ticket dataset and compared using various performance metrics. Ensemble based Random Forest classifier performed well when compared to all other considered models. The proposed model for the auto categorization of service desk tickets results in simplified user interface, faster ticket resolution, efficient resource utilization and improved growth in business.

0.7,SToRM: Smart ticket resolution steps recommendation in facilities management,2023,"Abhijeet Pandey, ..., and Abhishek Mishra","In modern times, different software tools are used in facilities maintenance to record maintenance problems as tickets. When these tickets are resolved, technicians also document the steps they took to fix the issue as resolution notes. The increasing use of these systems helps us gather a lot of information about past tickets and their solutions. Many times, similar tickets are created that can be solved by following similar steps used before. This abundance of data makes it easier to transfer knowledge by recommending resolution steps to solve a new issue based on the solutions applied to similar tickets in the past. The prompt and accurate resolution can help to minimize downtime and maximize productivity. Traditional methods of resolution recommendation for facilities maintenance tickets rely on manual analysis of historical data and predefined rules. These methods are time-consuming and often yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for resolution steps recommendation using deep learning techniques. We first generate embeddings of tickets using a fine-tuned sentence transformer model and employ FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) [9] to speed up the process of finding the most similar tickets. Our proposed resolution generator architecture first combines these similar tickets and then passes them to a summarization layer which clubs these resolutions into one, by removing redundancies and only considering actionable sentences. This summarized resolution is then passed to a text generation network which then converts these sentences into a series of steps that technicians can take to solve the current problem.

Automation in the ticket management system is now becoming highly desirable to manage the large number of submitted tickets. An automated ticket management system supports the management of a ticket by automating several parts of a ticket's lifecycle. In this context, ticket classification problem consists in assigning an appropriate label to a ticket to be utilized in the later stages of the ticket management cycle. In this paper, we use a collection of network-change tickets from a real network operator to solve a ticket classification problem. We observe that the network-change ticket dataset is highly skewed in the number of tickets for different possible classes. We address this challenge of classification in a highly imbalanced dataset by proposing two token-prioritization strategies along with other components.

0.6,Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows,2021,"Ze Liu, ..., and B. Guo","This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

This can be done because of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are several problems exists in building a system that can naturally understand and communicate with human. In communication, there are a number of slang words and local contexts or expressions that might change the meaning of the word. In the communication, there is always an intention of the speaker to the interlocutor. This can improve the machine’s understanding of human words and communicate with humans naturally.

For instance, the librarians may not be available all the time at the counter; reduction of physical contact due to Covid19 infection et cetera, machines can take over the librarians’ roles to handle the tasks. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot is proposed and implemented on mobile application to answer library-related questions. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm is employed to classify the intent of the user’s messages. Besides, many existing chatbot applications support only the text input. This paper proposes a speech-to-text recognition feature to enable both text and voice input. If there are any queries that cannot be solved by the chatbot system, it will store the queries in the database and the library admins can filter the queries and upload new training data for the AI model to cover a wider range of questions.",International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems,0,0.0,10.12785/ijcds/160101,https://doi.org/10.12785/ijcds/160101,"{'DOI': '10.12785/ijcds/160101', 'CorpusId': 269342724}",True,"{'url': 'https://journal.uob.edu.bh:443/bitstream/123456789/5283/3/IJCDS160101_1570979201.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD'}",f9029ba8e7a0517a879b6ae8f0072871dcd037e6,

The dataset features literary and critical texts from 19th-century Ottoman Turkish and Russian. It is the first study to apply large language models (LLMs) to this dataset, sourced from prominent literary periodicals of the era. The texts have been meticulously organized and labeled. This was done according to a taxonomic framework that takes into account both their structural and semantic attributes. Articles are categorized and tagged with bibliometric metadata by human experts. We present baseline classification results using a classical bag-of-words (BoW) naive Bayes model and three modern LLMs: multilingual BERT, Falcon, and Llama-v2. We found that in certain cases, Bag of Words (BoW) outperforms Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the need for additional research, especially in low-resource language settings.

Porter,"This paper focuses on the EmoWoz dataset, an extension of MultiWOZ that provides emotion labels for the dialogues. MultiWOZ was partitioned initially for another purpose, resulting in a distributional shift when considering the new purpose of emotion recognition. The emotion tags in EmoWoz are highly imbalanced and unevenly distributed across the partitions, which causes sub-optimal performance and poor comparison of models. We propose a stratified sampling scheme based on emotion tags to address this issue, improve the dataset's distribution, and reduce dataset shift. We also introduce a special technique to handle conversation (sequential) data with many emotional tags. Using our proposed sampling method, models built upon EmoWoz can perform better, making it a more reliable resource for training conversational agents with emotional intelligence.

Yet, the operational failures of DNS are not rare and sometimes lead to severe consequences like Internet outages. To gain a better understanding of DNS operational failures, previous works examined large-scale DNS logs (DNS queries and responses between Internet users and DNS servers), but the DNS logs cannot offer a comprehensive view of the failures (e.g., errors at domain registrars) and explain the failures at a finer grain. In this paper, we try to assess DNS operational failures from another data source, the supporting forums built by DNS service providers. Specifically, we mined 4 DNS forums and crawled more than 10000 posts and 50000 replies. With a new analysis framework developed by us, we are able to tag the forum posts by different categories (e.g., general concerns, issue locations, and record types), and gain new insights regarding how and why users encounter DNS failures.

With the ongoing increase in customer-care systems, it is crucial to have healthy relations with the users providing satisfaction and a better customer experience. In this regard, it is significant to model the different polite behaviors in an agent to help the user in reaching the intended objectives. In our current work, we propose the task of polite behavior-aware generation considering the affective state of the user and the conversational context. We design a Trans-former based encoder-decoder framework with three major components i.e., Affective tracker, Behaviour-aware generators, and Polite generator. The affective tracker is a context encoder that captures the contextual information along with the affective information in the utterances; the behavior-aware generators independently attends to the context information to compute behavior-aware polite representations and finally, polite generator generates the final polite response considering the representations from different generators.

0.1,Fast Regular Expression Matching Using FPGAs,2001,Reetinder P. S. Sidhu and V. Prasanna,"This paper presents an efficient method for finding matches to a given regular expression in given text using FPGAs. To match a regular expression of length n, a serial machine requires 0(2^n) memory and takes 0(1) time per text character. The proposed approach reqiures only 0(n^2) space and still process a text character in 0(1) time (one clock cycle).The improvement is due to the Nondetermineistic Finite Automaton (NFA) used to perform the matching. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first prctical use of a nondeterministic state machine on programmable logic. Furthermore, the paper presents a simple, fast algorithm that quickly constructs the NFA for the given regular expression. Fast NFA construction is crucial because the NFA structure depends on the regular expression, which is known only at runtime. Implementations of the algorithm for conventional FPGAs and the self-reconfigurable Gate Array (SRGA) are described. To evaluate performance, the NFA logic was mapped onto the Virtex XCV100 FPGA and the SRGA. Also, the performance of GNU grep for matching regular expressions was evaluated on an 800 MHz Pentium III machine. The proposed approach was faster than best case grep performance in most cases. It was orders of magnitude faster than worst case grep performance. Logic for the largest NFA considered fit in less than a 1000 CLBs while DFA storage for grep in the worst case consumed a few hundred megabytes.",The 9th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'01),615,25.9,10.1109/FCCM.2001.22,https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2001.22,"{'MAG': '1707172707', 'DBLP': 'conf/fccm/SidhuP01', 'DOI': '10.1109/FCCM.2001.22', 'CorpusId': 2759005}",False,,c2b36d79fe63363016611ffdd6383439de29ef95,
